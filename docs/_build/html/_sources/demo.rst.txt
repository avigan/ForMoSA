Tutorials
=========

There are several ways of using ForMoSA.

To get started, we recomend you to keep the following structure locally.

.. code-block:: bash

   ~/YOUR/PATH/formosa_desk/
   ├── atm_grids/
   ├── inversion_targetname/      
   │   ├── inputs/      
   │   ├── config.ini      
   │   ├── adapted_grid/ 
   │   └── outputs/
   ├── (ForMoSA/)
   ├── (PyMultiNest/)
   └── (MultiNest/)

Depending on the way you installed ForMoSA, the ForMoSA, PyMultiNest, and MultiNest subfolders need to be cloned from GitHub. 
Follow the :doc:`installation` 


Observation(s)
+++++++++++++++++

First, you need to format the observation you wish to invert in a .fits file. It should have the following extensions:

* **'WAV'**
* **'FLX'** 
* **'ERR'** or **'COV'** 
* **'RES'** 
* **'INS'** 

If you wish to invert on multiple observations, we recommend that you define separate files (data_1.fits, data_2.fits, ect...)

Ideally, save it/them inside the ``inputs/`` subdirectory.

Atmospheric grids
+++++++++++++++++

You now need an atmospheric grid on which to run your inversion.

This is the list of the publically available grids which we have formated for ForMoSA. 

Download the grid you want to use by clicking over it's name. Ideally, save it inside the ``atm_grids/`` subdirectory.

Configuration file
+++++++++++++++++

Finally, you need to prepare a configuration file.

This file (``config.ini``) allows you to communicate with ForMoSA.
