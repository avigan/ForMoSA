Comments:
    - No more covariance matrix if not provided in the impute observation file or if the covariance likelihood (chi2_covariance) is not used
    - Cleaner version of the covariances treatment during both the importation and the inversion
    - Correction of the importation of 'res_spectro' in adapt/extraction_functions.py
    - New function in main_utilities to compute the diagonal merging of covariance matrix (~ 100x faster)
    - Sorting of the glob.glob when using the MOSAIC (i.e. you can now number your observation files, ex: 1_obs1, 2_obs2, ...)

Comments:
    - Addition of checkups for the likelihoods (continuum checkups for the CCF and iterative checkups for the logL loop)
    - Correction of the continuum substraction function to make it run with custom ranges
    - Changes of the num_sigma parameter in extraction_functions to not smooth to much the models during the resolution decrease

Comments:
    - Small correction in the rv and vsini loops (len(flx) != 0, if you run with photometry only, usefull for MOSAIC)

Comments: 
    - I've modified the readme to include PyMultinest installation instructions.
    I've modified the authors list and requirements too.
    - I've added the lines Matthieu wrote about PyMultinest run.
    - I've completed the docstrings for many functions. 
    - I've modified the prints to have a consistent style over the code. 
    - I'm working on adapting the plotting function to be consistent for: MOSAIC, pymultinest, have a fat-check plot generator, ect...
