## DEMO tutorial

Works when the github repository is cloned.
Assuming you created a conda environment following the general instructions, you can lunch formosa from your terminal as:

***
& conda activate formosa_env

& python /path_to_folder/ForMoSA/ForMoSA/main.py ‘/path_to_ini_file/demo.ini’ y 


(the "y" at the end of the command line stands for doing the interpolation of the atmospheric grid, if the grid is already interpolated, then change "y" -> "n")

***

To plot and work with the outcomes please check the "output_plots.ipynb" example at the outputs folder of this DEMO.
